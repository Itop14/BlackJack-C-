In Blackjack, players aim to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealerâ€™s hand without exceeding 21. Each player is dealt two cards, and card values are as follows: numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on what benefits the hand. Players can choose to "hit" (take an additional card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). If a player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the round. The dealer must draw cards until reaching at least 17. If the dealer busts, remaining players win. If neither busts, the hand closest to 21 wins.
